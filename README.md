# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Netflix-Movies-1990s-

##  Description
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Netflix catalog, focusing on **movies released during the 1990s**. The goal is to analyze **movie duration patterns and genre distribution** using Python and common data analysis libraries.

---

## Analysis Objectives
- Analyze movie durations from the 1990s  
- Identify the **most frequent movie duration** during the decade  
- Quantify **short action movies** (defined as movies under 90 minutes)  
- Apply basic statistical concepts such as **mode and frequency**  
- Visualize results to support data-driven conclusions  

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**

---

## Key Findings
- Short action movies represent a specific fraction of total movie releases during the decade  
- The analysis emphasizes the importance of **correct filtering by content type and time range** when working with real-world datasets
